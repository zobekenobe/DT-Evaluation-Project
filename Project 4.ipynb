    "# Global Power Plant Database\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open source database of power plants around the world. It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare and draw insights for oneâ€™s own analysis. The database covers approximately 35,000 power plants from 167 countries and includes thermal plants (e.g. coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g. hydro, wind, solar). Each power plant is geolocated and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership, and fuel type. It will be continuously updated as data becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key attributes of the database\n",
    "\n",
    "The database includes the following indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `country` (text): 3 character country code corresponding to the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 specification [5]\n",
    "    `country_long` (text): longer form of the country designation\n",
    "    `name` (text): name or title of the power plant, generally in Romanized form\n",
    "    `gppd_idnr` (text): 10 or 12 character identifier for the power plant\n",
